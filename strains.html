      <p class="descript">Wedding Cake, also known as "Triangle Mints #23," is a potent type of indica-hybrid marijuana
        strain made by crossing Triangle Kush with Animal Mints. Fun fact: In Canada, this strain is known as Pink
        Cookies. The Wedding Cake strain provides relaxing and euphoric effects that calm the body and mind. This strain
        yields a rich and tangy flavor profile with undertones of earthy pepper. Medical marijuana patients choose

        Cake to help relieve symptoms associated with pain, insomnia and appetite loss. Consumers with a low THC
        tolerance
        should enjoy this strain with an extra slice of care due to its high THC content. Wedding Cake has soared in
        popularity over the years and was named Leafly Strain of the Year in 2019.</p>
