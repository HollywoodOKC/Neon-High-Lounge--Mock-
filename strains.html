    <p class="descript">Wedding Cake, also known as "Triangle Mints #23," is a potent type of indica-hybrid marijuana
      strain made by crossing Triangle Kush with Animal Mints. Fun fact: In Canada, this strain is known as Pink
      Cookies. The Wedding Cake strain provides relaxing and euphoric effects that calm the body and mind. This strain
      yields a rich and tangy flavor profile with undertones of earthy pepper. Medical marijuana patients choose Wedding
      Cake to help relieve symptoms associated with pain, insomnia and appetite loss. Consumers with a low THC tolerance
      should enjoy this strain with an extra slice of care due to its high THC content. Wedding Cake has soared in
      popularity over the years and was named Leafly Strain of the Year in 2019.</p>

    <p class="descript">Original Glue, also known as "Gorilla Glue," "Original Glue," "GG4," and "Gorilla Glue #4" is a
      potent hybrid marijuana strain that delivers heavy-handed euphoria and relaxation, leaving you feeling “glued” to
      the couch. Gorilla Glue's chunky, resin-covered buds fill the room with pungent earthy and sour aromas inherited
      from its parent strains, Chem’s Sister, Sour Dubb, and Chocolate Diesel. Taking first place in both the Michigan
      and Los Angeles 2014 Cannabis Cups as well as the High Times Jamaican World Cup, this multiple award-winning
      strain's supremacy is no longer a secret, and consumers will search far and wide to get their hands sticky with
      Original Glue (GG4).</p>

    <p class="descript">Runtz, also known as "Runtz OG," is a rare type of hybrid marijuana strain. Runtz is made by
      Cookies Fam by crossing Zkittlez with Gelato and it is loved for its incredibly fruity flavor profile that smells
      just like a bag of the sugary candy we all know and love. Because of the rising popularity of this cannabis
      strain, it's no surprise Runtz was named Leafly Strain of the Year in 2020. Growers say this strain has
      resin-drenched buds that range in color from rich purple to lime green. Runtz is celebrated for its creamy smoke
      that is smooth and welcoming. This strain of weed produces euphoric highs and uplifting effects that are known to
      be long-lasting. Purple Caper Seeds released the same cross under the name Gelato Zkittlez.</p>
